# ElasticNotebook: A Lightweight Checkpoint & Restore UI for Jupyter

This is a minimal, human-centered reimplementation of the ElasticNotebook system introduced in:

## What This Project Does

This notebook-based tool allows users to:
- Manually or automatically save variable checkpoints
- Restore notebook state at any time
- See the exact code that generated each checkpoint
- View variables and their types in a friendly UI

It builds on the original ElasticNotebook **concept**, but reimplements the logic using:
- `ipywidgets` for interactive UI
- `dill` for checkpoint serialization
- A simplified post-cell hook to simulate lineage tracking
